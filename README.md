**1. Configuration Instruction**

    This section contains 2 part: hardware configuration and software configuration.

1.1
Hardware configuration 

    + This program is designed for to ultilize a Raspberry Pi 3 with an USB soundcard, a headphone and a microphone, power cable.
    + Ethernet connection is required for saving data to a remote server. 
    + Raspberry Pi 3 onboard sound card doesn’t have microphone interface. 

    We have to change the default audio device to be USB sound card.

    To do this, follow these instructions:
        - Make sure the soundcard and micro phone is plugged in.
        - Use “lsusb” command to check if your USB sound card is mounted.
        - Use “sudo nano /etc/asound.conf” command and put following content to the file
                        pcm.!default {
                        type plug
                        slave {
                        pcm "hw:1,0"
                        }
                        }
                        ctl.!default {
                        type hw
                        card 1
                        }
        - Run "alsamixer" you should be able to see that USB sound card is the default audio device.

1.2 
Software configuration

    - This program require alsa-utils 1.0.25
    - If your system is using the 1.0.28 version, it is recommended to downgrade to the 1.0.25 version in 
    order to avoid bugs.

    To downgrade alsa-ultis, follow these instructions:
            - Use “sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list” command and add the last line.
            - Run “sudo apt-get update.
            - Run “sudo aptitude versions alsa-utils” to check if version 1.0.25 of alsa-util is available.
            - Run “sudo apt-get install alsa-utils=1.0.25-4” to downgrade.
            - Reboot (if necessary).

    To make sure alsa-ultils installation was ready:
            - Run “arecord -r44100 -c1 -f S16_LE -d5 test.wav” to test that your microphone is working. 
            You should see a “test.wav” file in the current folder.
            - Put earphone on. Run “aplay test.wav” to check that your recording is okay.

    This program also requrie libcurl library
       To install libcurl, follow these instructions:
            - First use command “ls /usr/include/curl” to identify that /usr/include/curl/ folder exists 
            or not.
            - If the folder doesn’t exist. Run “sudo apt-get update” to update the application list.
            - Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl3” to install the libcurl3.
            - Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev” to install the development API of libcurl4.


**2. Installation instruction**

        - Install the latest NOOBS version for Raspberry Pi.
        Get it at https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/
        - Set the external USB sound card as Default
        - Fix the bug of arecord by downgrade the alsa-utils from 1.0.28 to 1.0.25
        - Install libcurl and its development API

    The source code can be obtain from github by the command: 
    git pull https://github.com/Midnightlight/Raspberry_AppDev
    Once the source code has been downloaded, open the file comm.h to edit the url to your own receiving 
    php file: #define SERVER_URL your_url_here
    Then use the command make to automatically compile the program: make
    Run the program from the file wave.a as followed: ./wave.a your_device_name

**+ RPi Default Booting & Keyboard Layout**

1. By default Raspberry Pi boots into X-server (graphic) mode. This increases booting time, but in most 
cases we don't use a display with Raspberry Pi, so the first thing is to disable it. 
To do so, you need to connect RPi to a display via HDMI-DIV cable.
2. You also need a USB keyboard for this step. Connect it to your Raspberry Pi.
3. Once booted, open a "terminal" window (Ctrl + ESC, and choose from the "Accessories")
4. Run "sudo raspi-config" command.
5. Select from "boot options": "Text console, auto-login".
6. The newer version of Raspbian disables SSH by default, therefore you have to enable it. 
Navigate to "Interfacing Options" and select "SSH", choose "Yes", Select "Ok".
7. You can also change the keyboard to be "Generic 105 key/Finnish" in "4. Internationalization Options".
8. Reboot "sudo reboot"


**+ Send IP Address by Email** 

1. When using Raspberry Pi remotely, you need to know its IP address to connect to it.
There are many ways to get the IP address from your Pi. The simplest way to edit "rc.local" file.
2. First you need to get a digital signature of your student ID. Please run following command: 
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ curl --url "http://www.cc.puv.fi/~gc/php/sha_stuID.php" -d "id=e1700346"
And you will get:
welcome to SHA-1 hashing function
Your ID : e1700346
SHA hash of your ID: c040f7cde553dc1739ff9b6eebcb1d6f994ce3cb
3. Copy the SHA string to clipboard (in Putty window, Ctrl + "Insert" to copy, Shift + "Insert" to paste) 
and run command .sudo nano /etc/rc.local. and add following lines:
        #Print the IP address
        sleep 30
        _IP=$(hostname -I) || true
            if [ "$_IP" ]; then
            printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"
            curl --url http://www.cc.puv.fi/~gc/php/sendMailRPi.php -d .email=gc@vamk.fi&from=e1700346&hash=YOURHASH.
            curl --url http://www.cc.puv.fi/~gc/php/rasp.php -d "ip=$_IP&name=e1700346"
            curl --url http://www.cc.puv.fi/~juma/raspi/rasp_ip.php -d "auth=mckdoe03&name=e1700346&ip=$_IP"
            fi
            exit 0
4. The line .sleep 30. is to guarantee that IP address is available.
5. The 1st "curl" command sends IP address to your mail box (please change "email" to your email) using a 
PHP program. 
The program will verify your ID and signature so please make sure they are correct.
6. The 2nd "curl" command sends IP address to GC.s PHP page and you can see your device name/IP on 
http://www.cc.puv.fi/~gc/php/rasp.php. 
7. The 3rd .curl. command sends IP address to Jukka Matila.s PHP page and you can see your device in his page:
http://www.cc.puv.fi/~juma/raspi/. 


**+ Install USB sound card as default audio device**

1. Install alsamixer using command "sudo apt-get install alsa".
2. Boot up RPi, and apply the USB sound card.
3. RPi onboard sound card does not have microphone interface. We have to change the default audio device to be 
USB sound card.
4. Use command "lsusb" to check if your USB sound card is mounted.
5. Use "sudo nano /etc/asound.conf" command and put following content to the file:
                pcm.!default {
                type plug
                slave {
                pcm "hw:1,0"
                }
                }
                ctl.!default {
                type hw
                card 1
                }
6. Go to home directory. Use "nano .asoundrc" command and put the same content to the file.
7. Run "alsamixer" you should be able to see that USB sound card is the default audio device.
For a more sensitive sound detection, it is better to maximize the volume of "Mic".


**+ Install libcurl library**

1. First use command "ls/usr/include/curl" or "ls/usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/curl" to identify that libcurl library is installed
2. If the folder doesn't exist. Run "sudo apt-get update" to up-date the application list.
3. Run "sudo apt-get install libcurl3" to install the libcurl 3.
4. Run "sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev" to install the development API of libcurl 4.


**+ Adding files to your Github**
    ***- First setup -***
    
1. Create a respository on Github with "your respository name".
2. Go to your directory that you want to remote to Github on Linux.
3. Use command "echo "# your respository name" >> README.md".
4. Use command "git init".
5. git add README.md
6. git commit -m "first commit"
7. git remote add origin https://github.com/your username/your respository name.git
8. git push -u origin master

***- Uploading files -***

1. Use command line "git add" + your filenames that you want to upload.
2. Use "git status" to make sure it has been added for committing.
3. Use "git commit -m" + "your commit".
4. Use "git push origin master -u".
5. Login to your account and check the pushed files on your Github page.


**3. Operating Instruction**

        - Run command "make" to build the project.
        - Run command "./sound.out" to run the project. 
        You will see the columns which display the recorded sound.
        - You can also open "testcurl.txt" for accessing the recorded results.
        - To delete execution file, to command "make clean".
        - The recorded data is also sent to school server for storage.
