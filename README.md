**1. Configuration Instruction**

    This section contains 2 part: hardware configuration and software configuration.

1.1
Hardware configuration

    This program is designed for to ultilize a Rasperry Pi 3 with an USB soundcard and a microphone.
    Ethernet connection is required for saving data to a remote server.
    RPi onboard sound card doesn’t have microphone interface.

Hardware configuration 

    This program is designed for to ultilize a Rasperry Pi 3 with an USB soundcard and a microphone. 
    Ethernet connection is required for saving data to a remote server. 
    RPi onboard sound card doesn’t have microphone interface. 

    We have to change the default audio device to be USB sound card.

    To do this, follow these instructions:
        - Make sure the soundcard and micro phone is plugged in.
        - Use “lsusb” command to check if your USB sound card is mounted.
        - Use “sudo nano /etc/asound.conf” command and put following content to the file
                        pcm.!default {
                        type plug
                        slave {
                        pcm "hw:1,0"
                        }
                        }
                        ctl.!default {
                        type hw
                        card 1
                        }
        - Run "alsamixer" you should be able to see that USB sound card is the default audio device.


1.2
Software configuration

    - This program require alsa-utils 1.0.25
    - If your system is using the 1.0.28 version, it is recommended to downgrade to the 1.0.25 version in
    order to avoid bugs.

 To downgrade alsa-ultis, follow these instructions:

1.2 
Software configuration

    - This program require alsa-utils 1.0.25
    - If your system is using the 1.0.28 version, it is recommended to downgrade to the 1.0.25 version in 
    order to avoid bugs.

    To downgrade alsa-ultis, follow these instructions:
            - Use “sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list” command and add the last line.
            - Run “sudo apt-get update.
            - Run “sudo aptitude versions alsa-utils” to check if version 1.0.25 of alsa-util is available.
            - Run “sudo apt-get install alsa-utils=1.0.25-4” to downgrade.
            - Reboot (if necessary).


    To make sure alsa-ultils installation was ready:
            - Run “arecord -r44100 -c1 -f S16_LE -d5 test.wav” to test that your microphone is working.

            
    To make sure alsa-ultils installation was ready:
            - Run “arecord -r44100 -c1 -f S16_LE -d5 test.wav” to test that your microphone is working. 
            You should see a “test.wav” file in the current folder.
            - Put earphone on. Run “aplay test.wav” to check that your recording is okay.

    This program also requrie libcurl library
        To install libcurl, follow these instructions:

            - First use command “ls /usr/include/curl” to identify that /usr/include/curl/ folder exists

            - First use command “ls /usr/include/curl” to identify that /usr/include/curl/ folder exists 
            or not.
            - If the folder doesn’t exist. Run “sudo apt-get update” to update the application list.
            - Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl3” to install the libcurl3.
            - Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev” to install the development API of libcurl4.


**2. Installation instruction**

        - Install the latest NOOBS version for Raspberry Pi.
        Get it at https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/
        - Set the external USB sound card as Default
        - Fix the bug of arecord by downgrade the alsa-utils from 1.0.28 to 1.0.25
        - Install libcurl and its development API

    The source code can be obtain from github by the command: 
    git pull https://github.com/Midnightlight/Raspberry_AppDev
    Once the source code has been downloaded, open the file comm.h to edit the url to your own receiving 
    php file: #define SERVER_URL your_url_here
    Then use the command make to automatically compile the program: make
    Run the program from the file wave.a as followed: ./wave.a your_device_name


**3. Operating Instruction**

        - Run command "make" to build the project.
        - Run command "./sound.out" to run the project. 
        You will see the columns which display the recorded sound.
        - You can also open "testcurl.txt" for accessing the recorded results.
        - To delete excution file, to command "make clean".
        - The recorded data is also sent to school server for storage.
